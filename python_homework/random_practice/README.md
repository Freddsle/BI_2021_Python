 Code in `python_homework\random_practice\practice_random.py`

- `generate_plot_list` - measures time of generete random list via Random (uses pre-created list and without it) and random arrays via Numpy. Also measures time of generete random numbers via Random and via Numpy in 'range' loop. For a more accurate calculation, the measurement is repeated 10 rows. As a rusuts generates plot.
- `shuff_sort_plot` - measures the time needed for Monkey sorting of input list (also creates a list with different lenght). For a more accurate calculation, the measurement is repeated 5 rows.
