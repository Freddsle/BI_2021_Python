# Practice with regular expressions.

1.  Parsing of the references file (in the `files` folder) and write all "ftp" links from there to the "ftps" file (results in the `files` folder).

2.  Parsing of the tale file (in the `files` folder) and write:
  - all numbers from there to the `tale_numbers.txt` file.
  - all words that contain the letter a, case is not important, to the `tale_a_words.txt` file.
  - all exclamation sentences to the `tale_exclamation.txt` file.
  
  - Also a histogram of the distribution of the lengths of unique words (case-insensitive, length from 1) in the tale text was plot. Result is in the `.png` file in the `files` folder.
